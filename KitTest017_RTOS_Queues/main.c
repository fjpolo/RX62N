/* 
*  This example demonstrates a queue being created, data being sent to
* the queue from multiple tasks, and data being received from the queue.
* The queue is created to hold data items of type int32_t. The tasks
* that send to the queue do not specify a block time, whereas the task
* that receives from the queue does.
*  The priority of the tasks that send to the queue are lower than the
* priority of the task that receives from the queue. This means the queue
* should never contain more than one item because, as soon as data is sent
* to the queue the receiving task will unblock, pre-empt the sending task,
* and remove the dataâ€”leaving the queue empty once again.
